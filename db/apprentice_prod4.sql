Then you could learn how to build sets and stages for film productions, or how to work the machines that manufacture clothing.\r\n\r\nThere\'s also a strong administrative side to this industry, so you could find yourself contributing to the office of a busy record label, helping to promote a live event, or organising member information for a theatre. You could even take on a more socially-engaged role by working for a community arts programme.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll find most opportunities in London and larger cities, but there are openings for creative types in most places. Imagination and a flair for English, art, music or a similar creative subject can help you succeed in the creative industries. But this is also a sector where passion and hard work will get you far.\r\n\r\nDon\'t expect the red carpet treatment right away - long, antisocial hours are not unusual, and the pay is often not great for junior staff. But the work is fun and fulfilling, and you\'ll be working with interesting and creative people.\r\n\r\n','',NULL,5,'2012-07-20 01:57:41','2012-07-20 01:57:41');

A satisfied customer is not only a good advert for your business, but they\'re likely to buy from you again. An unhappy customer, on the other hand, is not just a customer you\'ve lost - they can also do untold damage to your reputation.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that a whole field has grown up devoted to keeping customers happy. In a small shop, customer service can be as simple - and important - as the person behind the counter giving a friendly greeting and helping shoppers find what they\'re looking for. Larger businesses and other organisations might employ a dedicated customer service team, whose job it is to answer questions, give advice and offer refunds on faulty products or services. They\'re also the ones who have to sort out problems and deal with complaints.\r\n\r\nCustomer service often involves dealing with the public face-to-face, but as many companies now have clients all round the world, telephone call centres and computer helpdesks are becoming increasingly important.\r\n\r\nAs well as serving their existing customers, businesses need to find new ones - and to persuade them to buy things. This is where sales comes in - salespeople persuade customers to buy products or services, and the business they bring in keeps the customer services team busy.\r\n\r\nCustomer service is at the heart of most business activity, so the skills gained from the Apprenticeships in this section will prove valuable across a range of industries and roles.','',NULL,6,'2012-07-20 01:58:46','2012-07-20 01:58:46');

The Apprenticeships in this section provide entry routes into all of these areas.\r\n\r\nKeeping gas, electricity and water supply in check isn\'t easy. By nature, gas hates being in an enclosed space and is always looking for a place to escape. A gas leak could potentially cause an explosion, so anyone working with this substance needs to be highly skilled - any mistake could have serious consequences.\r\n\r\nThis section also features two Apprenticeships in the growing nuclear industry, which produces roughly 20% of the electricity in the UK. The provision of nuclear power and the safe decommissioning (or closing down) of the UK\'s older nuclear power plants both rate highly on the government agenda. This sort of work involves skills that are transferable to other sectors within this industry, as well as engineering.\r\n\r\nThe many roles in this sector require people with all sorts of skills. Practical roles like pipe fitting, line repair and cable jointing are in high demand, as are plant operatives. There\'s also a large administrative and commercial side to the industry.\r\n\r\nEvery household and company in the country has an electricity bill to pay - that\'s a lot of customers to look after, and a lot of administrative work. All the major supply companies have large contact centres to deal with areas like customer service and sales.\r\n\r\nApprenticeships are a popular method of entry into this sector, and many of today\'s managers and supervisors were once apprentices. Also, much of the skilled workforce is now approaching retirement age, which means excellent career prospects when you qualify.','',NULL,7,'2012-07-20 01:59:38','2012-07-20 01:59:38');

Voices babbling down telephone lines and over the radio waves. Gas pumping through pipes into ovens and heaters. Water gushing from taps and cisterns, down drains and into sewers. Computers spinning webs of data while moving pictures bounce off satellites onto TV screens.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a wonder it doesn\'t descend into absolute chaos. That it doesn\'t is thanks to a legion of skilled people making sure their part of the system functions as it should - the plumber mending a broken pipe to the team of electricians wiring up an office block to an engineer servicing a broken escalator.\r\n\r\nThe engineering and electrical sector is all about making things work. It\'s a huge field, so you\'ll specialise in a particular area. For example, few Apprenticeships offer as many diverse pathways as the engineering Apprenticeship - you could be demolishing buildings, servicing escalators, checking RAF aircraft or activating phone lines for BT - and that\'s just the start of a long list of opportunities.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: you\'ll need to be good with machines, whether your specialism is fixing faulty DVD players in a local electrical store, or maintaining the machinery in a factory. You\'ll often need to be good with people, too - you might be going into somebody\'s home to fix their fridge or to stem the flood in their bathroom.\r\n\r\nManual and technical skills are important in this sector, and maths, IT and science are often relevant. You need to be good at following instructions and working as part of a team, but engineers in particular often need to use their own initiative to solve problems.\r\n\r\nProspects are good in this sector. And while there are many large firms on the lookout for skilled employees, a lot of electricians and plumbers are self-employed and run their own companies. If you think you can combine your manual and mechanical skills with a head for business, there\'s a healthy living to be made.','',NULL,8,'2012-07-20 02:00:33','2012-07-20 02:00:53');

Almost every business is set up in order to make money, and making money is not something that happens automatically - it requires careful planning and constant attention.\r\n\r\nCompanies big and small need teams of people to look after their finances: monitoring who they need to pay, who owes them money and so on. They need people to help them sort out their tax bills and make sure all their employees get paid on time, while making them as profitable as possible. Those finance experts are, generally speaking, people with good organisational skills and a good head for numbers.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, it\'s not just businesses that need help with their money. From the student taking out a loan to cover tuition fees, to the entrepreneur putting on a festival, to the retired person claiming their pension, everyone needs financial help and advice at some stage. And it\'s employees in banks, accountants and insurance companies who offer that help. Again, people working in these roles are organised, and good with numbers. But it\'s equally important to be good with people and enjoy the challenge of helping others achieve their financial goals.\r\n\r\nBy choosing to do an Apprenticeship in this area, you\'ll have made a shrewd financial decision. You\'ll be working towards a qualification that should see you earn a higher salary in the future. And instead of running into debt - as you\'d be likely to do if you stayed in full time education - you\'ll be earning while you learn.\r\n\r\nNot only will you be qualified to help other people manage their money, you\'ll also find it easier to manage your own. And as a great many jobs in the finance sector come with a higher-than-average salary, you could find yourself, quite literally, in the money.','',NULL,9,'2012-07-20 02:01:48','2012-07-20 02:01:48');

In the UK alone, the sector is worth more than £8.9 billion per year, and employs over a million employees and 500,000 volunteers. It\'s a profitable sector, but that\'s only part of it - this industry improves quality of life here in the UK by supplying us with food, producing crops, enriching the rural and urban environment, and protecting our natural heritage.\r\n\r\nLand-based and environmental industries can be broken down into three major categories: land management and production, animal health and welfare, and environmental industries. There are a wide variety of jobs in the sector, and most of them are practical, requiring physical effort and work outdoors.\r\n\r\nPeople you will find in the field include general farm workers, gardeners, fencing contractors, tree surgeons and gamekeepers. There are also creative occupations available, such as floristry; as well as caring jobs that include working for animal welfare charities, as a veterinary nurse, or at a kennels or cattery. In addition, there are more technical roles on offer, such as land-based engineering, and many management opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe Apprenticeships in this section cover 17 different disciplines, from land-based engineering to veterinary nursing. Each of these industries offers the chance to develop skills in practical, technical and specialised areas with opportunities for career progression.

INSERT INTO `how_to_applies` (`id`,`content`,`created_at`,`updated_at`,`help_title`) VALUES (11,'<p>There are many good things to say about Apprenticeships. Here\'s ten for starters.<b><br></b></p><p><b>1. Something for everyone</b> – Worried you won’t find something that interests you? That\r\nshouldn’t be a problem: there are over 250 Apprenticeship schemes available,\r\ncovering pretty much every sort of career.<br><br><b>2. The real world</b> – Lots of people can’t wait to get out of full-time education\r\n– they want to be\r\nout in the world, doing a proper job and earning proper money. An\r\nApprenticeship allows you to do this while still building up skills for the\r\nfuture.<br><b><br>3. Earn while you learn</b> – You’re paid a wage when you do an Apprenticeship, and having\r\nan income will make a major difference to your life.\r\nIt’s money you deserve: you may still be learning, but you’re doing a proper\r\njob and making a real contribution to your employer’s business.<br><b><br>4. Location, location, location</b> – Except for obvious exceptions like seafishing, most\r\nApprenticeships are offered all over the country. You should be able to find something that suits you in your local area – but\r\nif you want to move somewhere new, an Apprenticeship could be the\r\nideal springboard.<br><b><br>5. Building up Britain</b> – Apprenticeships and other forms of vocational training are vital to the British economy: they build up the skills of our\r\nworkforce and keep us competitive at an international level. New standards\r\nquarantee the quality of Apprenticeships and they are\r\nreceiving lots of support from the Government – there’s never been a better\r\ntime to do one.<br><b><br>6. Meet new friends</b> – You’ll mix with a \r\nwhole new group of people when you take an\r\nApprenticeship. Many companies are very sociable places, and you’ll \r\nprobably spend quite a bit of time with your new colleagues outside \r\nwork. That\r\ndoesn’t mean you’ll lose your old friends, but having new ones\r\ncan only be a bonus.<br><b><br>7. Practical lessons</b> – Taking an Apprenticeship means spending some time in the\r\nclassroom, but the lessons you learn will be directly related to the job you’re\r\ndoing and they’ll help you in your working life. It’s nothing like school:\r\nthese are lessons for professional adults, which is exactly what you’ll be.\r\nYou’ll receive at least 280 hours of guided learning per year.<br><b><br>8. A flying start</b> – You’ll progress much more quickly in your career\r\nif you pick up some formal skills and qualifications along the way. You’ll work\r\nalongside experienced staff to gain job-specific skills. Taking an\r\nApprenticeship means you’ll receive a high-quality, nationally recognised\r\nqualification – such as an NVQ. Getting paid to give yourself a headstart in\r\nthe job market sounds like a pretty good idea.<br><b><br>9. Growing up fast</b> – Many people find that the experience of getting a job\r\nquickly makes them more capable and confident. Having professional\r\nresponsibilities can be challenging, but it’s a positive kind of challenge that\r\nshould make a great difference to your life.<br><b><br>10. Transferable skills</b> – Taking an Apprenticeship doesn’t restrict you to one\r\nspecific job role. You’ll pick up a number of skills\r\nthat’ll make you more attractive to other employers, from basic skills like\r\nteamwork and health and safety awareness, to more specialised capabilities that\r\nwill help you progress through your industry.\r\n</p>','2012-12-06 15:10:01','2012-12-06 15:10:01','Benefits of an Apprenticeship');
