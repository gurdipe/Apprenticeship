Typical work activities might include researching, analysing and interpreting changing tax regulation, liaising and negotiating with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), or providing guidance and support on other taxation issues and processes.\r\nIf you choose the tax pathway, you will be working towards the Association of Taxation Technicians (ATT) professional qualification. Your role could include assisting in the preparation of tax returns; assisting in the completion of various tax forms; dealing with client communications in respect of their tax affairs; and preparation of simple accounting statements.\r\nBoth the Audit and Tax pathways are the first step on the ladder towards full chartered status with a chartered body such as the ICAEW or the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT). A consultant is an individual that is trained to analyse and advise a client to help them make the best possible choices, and to help management solve complex issues that affect their business. The day-to-day activities of management consultancy are often varied. Consultancy is essentially entrepreneurial in nature and project-based. Projects can vary in length depending on the type of consultancy, business culture and the demands or industry of the client. They might work as an individual or as part of a large team, and can be based at one site or across several international borders.\r\n\r\nManagement consultancy\r\nThe Consulting pathway could see you taking on two main types of role. As a junior consultant you would assist in the delivery of consulting projects for external or internal clients, working as part of a consulting team supporting the engagement leadership. You might be using your organisational skills to support project management or the consulting sales process, carrying out detailed analysis of the client situation, or helping to make recommendations for clients’ businesses and implement solutions.\r\nAs an account executive or business development assistant, you would support client account teams in relationship management – the tracking and managing of key accounts and relationships – and business development. This would involve tasks such as preparing sales materials and supporting pitch development, or carrying out internal and external communications activities.\r\nIn both roles, a key emphasis would be on developing your own consulting skill-set and core business competence.\r\n\r\nThrough all three pathways you will develop specialist skills alongside a strong foundation of core business competence valued by all professional services employers. The combination of work experience and technical knowledge will give you a great start for a successful career in the professional services sector.','Level: Higher (Level 4)','Job roles: External/Internal audit trainee, Tax trainee, Junior consultant, Account executive, Business development assistant','Issuing Authority: Financial Skills Partnership – www.financialskillspartnership.org.uk','','27/11/13','Higher Apprenticeship','Starting salary (upon completion of Apprenticeship): £13,000– £25,000, depending on company and location within the UK');

You would also undertake some administrative duties, including completing forms, writing reports and liaising with colleagues. You need to have a mature, determined and self-confident attitude. Investigating and detecting crime demands an inquisitive but open mind, as well as a genuine interest in police work. You will be able to work unsupervised, and to think and act independently. An honest nature is vital as police officers have a high level of responsibility; applicants should not have any civil convictions.\r\nYou can apply for the Defence Policing pathway via application to the Royal Military Police. You will need to complete the Army’s Phase 1 Basic Training and be selected for the Royal Military Police. The training will give you the basic military skills to undertake the duties required of a soldier and will prepare you for further stages of training. You must be prepared to be posted anywhere within the UK or overseas.\r\nCompleting the Policing Apprenticeship will stand you in good stead for further job roles within the Royal Military Police. You may also be able to progress onto Higher Education courses, such as Criminology, Criminal Law, Forensic Science and Community Justice.\r\nOn average, completion of the Apprenticeship takes approximately 14 months.\r\n','Level: Advanced (Level 3)','Job role: Non-commissioned officer','Issuing Authority: Skills for Justice – www.skillsforjustice.com','','','','Starting salary:£23,000– £25,000');

It\'s no wonder that many upper level staff members rely on the assistance of administrators to do their jobs.\r\n\r\nBusiness Management staff - from team leaders and supervisors up to company directors - make decisions about how to do things effectively and provide leadership. Equally important are human resources (HR), who look after the people who work for the organisation and also help with recruiting and training staff.\r\n\r\nMarketing and public relations (PR) is a method of telling people about your company or product - whether through advertising or sponsorship, publicity stunts or viral videos on the internet. It\'s about attracting customers and keeping them - the foundation of business activity.\r\n\r\nAll of these roles use computers in some way. The IT sector can be divided into two categories: the companies that provide IT solutions - such as web developers - and those that use IT in some form with their business (which is pretty much everyone else).\r\n\r\nMost jobs in this industry are office-based with a typical 9 to 5, Monday to Friday working week.

One in 14 of the UK\'s workforce is employed in construction (that\'s nearly two million people), and the task of building everything needed for the London 2012 Olympics will create approximately 33,500 additional jobs over the next few years.\r\n\r\nApprenticeships are a recognised and valued route of entry into construction. There are 38 different Apprenticeships covering a range of occupations, from groundworks and plant maintenance to civil engineering and joinery. No matter where you start your career, if you have the determination and are ready to work hard, there\'ll be plenty of scope to move up the career ladder. It\'s also worth noting that in the construction industry, more than 35% of people are their own boss and run their own company.\r\n\r\nThere\'s lots to choose from: if you\'re the sort who enjoys physical work, you could help lay the foundations of a 20-storey building; build scaffolding around a famous landmark due for restoration; plaster the interior of an office building; or maintain heavy plant. Those with a flair for organisation could help make sure projects run on time and within budget; liaise with suppliers; or assist a civil engineer with design plans - there are many places to put your creative skills to the test.\r\n\r\nWith a construction Apprenticeship, you could be working on various sites in your region and beyond - there are also plenty of opportunities to work abroad, as many of the largest construction companies operate around the world. Whatever profession you decide to pursue, you can count on the fact that your work will be used and admired by people for years to come.

This sector, also known as the voluntary sector, consists of a range of charities and organisations that exist to help the local, national and, in some cases, the international community. Examples of such organisations include, Macmillan Cancer Support, Children in Need, Comic Relief, Unicef and Oxfam. As well as the large charities, over 50% of the sector consists of small organisations that help the local community. For example there may be a small organisation in your area that is helping to regenerate the community, or providing services for disadvantaged people.\r\n\r\nThere is a huge variety of paid employment available and there is currently a demand for Apprenticeships within this sector. New apprenticeships have been specifically developed and tailored for three professional roles within the voluntary sector: Fundraising, Campaigning and Volunteer Management.\r\n\r\nBy undertaking an Apprenticeship within one of these areas you will develop the necessary skills to provide you with a great start in a career within this sector. The skills you learn will also give you the opportunity to work in the voluntary sector permanently, meaning you can play a big part in achieving real changes in society.\r\n\r\nIf you are already employed by a voluntary sector organisation, completing an Apprenticeship will further enhance your CV by recognising your learning and development through nationally accredited qualifications. It also offers you the opportunity to professionalise your job roles through recognised learning.\r\n\r\nThe ability to complete Functional Skills in English, Maths and ICT along with an interest in the work of work of charities, social enterprises or voluntary and community organisations is the only entry requirement for these apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nA career in this sector can be very challenging but at the same time extremely rewarding.','',NULL,4,'2012-07-20 01:56:50','2012-07-20 01:56:50');

It\'s not easy to walk into your dream job in TV or the fashion industry, so an Apprenticeship can be a great way to get a foot in the door.\r\n\r\nCreativity takes on many forms, and likewise, the creative industry encompasses a broad array of jobs requiring different practices, talents and skills. The Apprenticeships in this section sample a good portion of that range. If you\'re technically creative, then you could be a games tester searching for glitches in new computer games or help rig the lighting for a playhouse. Like working with your hands? Then you could learn how to build sets and stages for film productions, or how to work the machines that manufacture clothing.\r\n\r\nThere\'s also a strong administrative side to this industry, so you could find yourself contributing to the office of a busy record label, helping to promote a live event, or organising member information for a theatre. You could even take on a more socially-engaged role by working for a community arts programme.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll find most opportunities in London and larger cities, but there are openings for creative types in most places.

A satisfied customer is not only a good advert for your business, but they\'re likely to buy from you again. An unhappy customer, on the other hand, is not just a customer you\'ve lost - they can also do untold damage to your reputation.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that a whole field has grown up devoted to keeping customers happy. In a small shop, customer service can be as simple - and important - as the person behind the counter giving a friendly greeting and helping shoppers find what they\'re looking for. Larger businesses and other organisations might employ a dedicated customer service team, whose job it is to answer questions, give advice and offer refunds on faulty products or services. They\'re also the ones who have to sort out problems and deal with complaints.\r\n\r\nCustomer service often involves dealing with the public face-to-face, but as many companies now have clients all round the world, telephone call centres and computer helpdesks are becoming increasingly important.\r\n\r\nAs well as serving their existing customers, businesses need to find new ones - and to persuade them to buy things. This is where sales comes in - salespeople persuade customers to buy products or services, and the business they bring in keeps the customer services team busy.\r\n\r\nCustomer service is at the heart of most business activity, so the skills gained from the Apprenticeships in this section will prove valuable across a range of industries and roles.','',NULL,6,'2012-07-20 01:58:46','2012-07-20 01:58:46');

The Apprenticeships in this section provide entry routes into all of these areas.\r\n\r\nKeeping gas, electricity and water supply in check isn\'t easy. By nature, gas hates being in an enclosed space and is always looking for a place to escape. A gas leak could potentially cause an explosion, so anyone working with this substance needs to be highly skilled - any mistake could have serious consequences.\r\n\r\nThis section also features two Apprenticeships in the growing nuclear industry, which produces roughly 20% of the electricity in the UK. The provision of nuclear power and the safe decommissioning (or closing down) of the UK\'s older nuclear power plants both rate highly on the government agenda. This sort of work involves skills that are transferable to other sectors within this industry, as well as engineering.\r\n\r\nThe many roles in this sector require people with all sorts of skills. Practical roles like pipe fitting, line repair and cable jointing are in high demand, as are plant operatives. There\'s also a large administrative and commercial side to the industry.\r\n\r\nEvery household and company in the country has an electricity bill to pay - that\'s a lot of customers to look after, and a lot of administrative work. All the major supply companies have large contact centres to deal with areas like customer service and sales.\r\n\r\nApprenticeships are a popular method of entry into this sector, and many of today\'s managers and supervisors were once apprentices.

They need people to help them sort out their tax bills and make sure all their employees get paid on time, while making them as profitable as possible. Those finance experts are, generally speaking, people with good organisational skills and a good head for numbers.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, it\'s not just businesses that need help with their money.

As the farm was based in Bedfordshire, relocation was involved, but this didn’t deter Leon.\r\nThe farm specialised in producing onions and was much bigger than the one he had worked on after leaving school.\r\nLeon gained several qualifications while working on the farm, including Pesticides, Rough Terrain Telescopic Lift Truck, Emergency First Aid at Work and Manual Handling. “Most of these were achieved at work through my employer and some of them through college. Training and certification was viewed as very important by my employer,” he explains.\r\nIn 2011 Leon met the owner of a Lincolnshire-based arable farm that specialises in potatoes. “The owner was interested in taking me on as an arable apprentice and I decided that this would be a good opportunity to continue my education and work on a highly mechanised farm,” he says.

He also acts as relief potato planter operator when the primary operator takes a break.\r\nThere is a variety of key skills required for the role accordingly to Leon. “Listening is especially important, because much of our work is complex and undertaken alone so it is important to know and remember all the tasks that need doing,” he says. “Good timekeeping is also vital. I have to use my own initiative and I must be able to solve minor problems on my own, such as repairing machinery. Communicating with other employees is important too.”\r\nLeon has some useful advice for anyone wishing to pursue a similar career path: “Do not be put off by moving to get the job that you want.

The energy industry is today an increasingly exciting place to work because it’s at the heart of a modern economy and future UK growth. With so many crucial engineering, investment and environmental challenges to meet, the future can only be delivered through people, and Advanced and Higher Apprenticeships play a key role in our workforce strategy.\r\nI have worked in energy for over 30 years and at National Grid for over 10 years, which reflects my own personal passion for this industry. When I first started out, what I valued the most was the opportunity to get involved early on and develop my skills, through a mix of varied practical experiences and formal training, and support and encouragement from my manager – and this remains key to our Apprenticeships today.\r\nAt National Grid we have a long history of delivering leading-edge Apprenticeship programmes which are graded by Ofsted as Outstanding in every category and recognised as a Beacon by the LSIS (Learning and Skills Improvement Service). A critical element of the Apprenticeship framework is the support structure, whereby Co-ordinators, Mentors and Line Managers give personal support to our apprentices within a work-based education framework, managed by our Technical Learning & Development team. I believe this is why we continue to achieve very high retention rates (95%), endorsed in the excellent feedback we receive from apprentices, both formally and informally.\r\nWhen you qualify following your Apprenticeship at National Grid you will have the defined knowledge, skills and qualifications for your job and destination role. But, more importantly, you will have the opportunity to develop further into craftsperson roles where you can build your experience and knowledge towards Engineering Technician registration.

In May 2012 we were delighted to receive funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund to create new Building Apprenticeships. We are aiming to hire apprentices who have been made unemployed as a result of the recession.\r\nWe aim to provide our apprentices with excellent training and an enjoyable experience.

There was no great master plan, no splendidly glorious complete vision, and in some ways, there still isn’t. I started working within the floristry industry aged 13, scrubbing buckets every weekend. I’ve always had a strong work ethic, and I got stuck right in, desperate to learn everything I could from the very first day. It was there that I fell in love with floral design, and I decided to make it my career.\r\nI studied for a Level 2 certificate in floral design at my local college after completing my GCSEs. My college course was two and a half days a week and I spent the rest of my time working on an open-air flower stall in Liverpool city centre. It was not the most glamorous of places to start but I absolutely loved it, and the studio where I work today is just down the road from that stall.\r\nAfter finishing at college, I began entering vocational competitions as a way to progress my career (my college wasn’t running a Level 3 course and it was up to me to invest in my own future). Don’t get me wrong: I enjoyed college and I am quite academic, but when college couldn’t provide me with a route to get where I wanted to go, entering competitions provided an alternative pathway, albeit a risky one.\r\nMy initial experience of competing at a regional level was not very successful, but after a while I began to come third, then second, and finally to win, which would take me through to national finals. At this point I started to take my career seriously. I began investing my monthly wages into my education – I booked myself onto day courses, bought design books and begged to assist top UK designers at shows and installations. I literally immersed myself into the industry, and it began to pay off.\r\nAt 19, I won my first National award, and I have never looked back. I continued to work in both retail and event floristry and my work began to attract international attention from publications and clients. I spent six months working in New York in 2012, then returned to the UK in January 2013 to launch my own company, Joseph Massie Creative. I now specialise in couture floral design for clients such as Sky, Universal Studios, ASDA and Kildare Village, creating art and design installations for a huge variety of projects. I regularly demonstrate and lecture at the colleges throughout the UK, and I’ve just come back from a second tour of China, demonstrating my skills in a host of cities in association with the British Council.\r\nI didn’t follow an Apprenticeship scheme – it simply wasn’t offered to me and I didn’t know what an Apprenticeship was – but I now know that an Apprenticeship is a really beneficial way of achieving a qualification while gaining on-the-job training, especially for a hands-on skill such as floral design.\r\nI think my career is a good example of how starting small and working with what you love can lead to bigger and better things.

I took a different approach to working from everyone else, using up every moment of the Michaeljohn opening hours (8 am till 8 pm) and not taking a lunch break, which meant I was available to pick up all last-minute appointments.

It’s a brilliant route to take if you want to start working, training and learning straight away and are fearful of the burden of three years of tuition fees and university debt, or just simply don’t want to go! In today’s world, it’s far less of a stigma not to have a degree. A Higher Apprenticeship in Assurance/Audit will give you a great insight into what an exciting and varied career accountancy is. Or you can study levels 1 to 4 of the AAT’s Diploma in Accounting as an Apprenticeship. This will give you valuable knowledge and experience that will count towards the ACA qualification if you decide you want to become an ICAEW Chartered Accountant.\r\nAs a recruiter of many qualified professionals over the years, I put huge emphasis on the ability to communicate effectively across finance and non-finance people, to be able to think creatively about ways around problems and, increasingly, to be able to write and speak well – and I worry far less about the route a candidate took to get there.\r\nAnyone with a spreadsheet can call themselves an accountant. It’s the wider skills we’ve learned during our training and in the workplace that mean we can be proud to call ourselves Chartered Accountants.\r\n\r\nA passion for a great brand and an exciting organisation full of equally passionate people led Tim Williams to his current role as Financial Controller for Manchester United. He looks after the day-to-day running of a busy finance department of some 30 people, comprising financial reporting, payables, receivables and payroll (including all player wages). His days are incredibly varied, and can involve anything from ad hoc analysis of the overall business, updating budgets and forecasts when players are bought and sold to making sure that all the cash from a match the day before has been counted. The aspect of his role that takes up a lot of time, but isn’t strictly down to the numbers, is to ensure that, as far as possible, each one of the 30 or so members of his staff are happy, challenged and working to the best of their abilities and that the mix of skills is right for the current and future business needs.','','','','',NULL,'','2013-12-19 14:17:30','2013-12-19 14:17:30');

I am so proud that some 30 or so of these chefs have gone on to win Michelin stars and hundreds of others are now head chefs. My oldest apprentice started in 1979 and now he is a Director of the Raymond Blanc Cookery School.\r\nI have continued this process at all 19 of my Brasserie Blanc restaurants and when I heard about the Mayor of London’s Apprenticeship programme I saw a way in which I could contribute still further.\r\nThe food and hospitality sector employs around 300,000 people in London alone: of these only 5,000 are apprentices. As such there is potential for businesses to get involved and help introduce young people to a sector that offers such a range of fantastic opportunities.\r\nAt Brasserie Blanc we are taking on 21 apprentices, not only in London but across the UK. They will work in a range of hospitality roles, including trainee chefs and front of house staff.\r\nAged between 16 and 19, the apprentices will be assigned a mentor within the business and will also be assessed and supported by the De Vere Training Academy, representatives from which will meet with them on a monthly basis.\r\nOur Apprenticeship programme will be split into modules, some of which are based around NVQs. Each apprentice will receive a final certificate on completion.\r\nAs employers, we want to provide a nurturing, caring environment to give young people the very best chance to succeed. I know that all of my colleagues also believe that it is vital that the restaurant and hospitality sector develops our home-grown talent and that we pass on the necessary skills for the future. Long term, our businesses will gain from it.\r\n\r\nRaymond Blanc was born in Besançon in eastern France. The area boasts some of the best dairy, meat and fish of France, and his mother used only fresh, local and seasonal produce to cook tasty meals for her family. Raymond arrived in England in 1972, to work as a waiter at the Rose Revived near Witney. When the Head Chef became ill, Raymond took over in the kitchen. Using the knowledge and love of food that he inherited from his mother, the restaurant soon gained an entry in the Michelin Guide. His success continues to this day, and Le Manoir Aux Quat’ Saisons and his Brasserie Blancs have won many awards.','www.brasserieblanc.com','','','',NULL,'','2013-12-19 14:20:22','2013-12-19 14:20:22');

He relentlessly promoted and expanded Apprenticeships and was determined to make sure that vocational learning was recognised as being of equal value to academic education. The new Skills Minister, Matthew Hancock, has continued this good work with equal enthusiasm.\r\nIt was very apparent to me that apprentices bring real benefits to the organisations that take them on, while developing skills and earning qualifications for themselves, so I decided to hire an apprentice for my Westminster office. Not only would this help me to deal even more efficiently with my Parliamentary and constituency responsibilities, it would also be an excellent opportunity for a young and motivated person starting out on their career path to gain significant experience of the workplace.\r\nWorking with the National Apprenticeship Service, I quickly found an exemplary apprentice, Dominic Woodbridge, who greatly aided the functioning of my office. Dominic had just completed his A-levels and had decided to take the vocational route rather than go to university. He was employed as my apprentice at the House of Commons, and spent the first three months being introduced to the parliamentary calendar and associated deadlines. He was responsible for the management of appointments requests and visited my constituency in Bromsgrove on several occasions to gain a clear understanding of the environment I work in and the people I represent.\r\nDominic was a perfect example of everything that an apprentice should be. He quickly proved himself to be an extremely capable young man and his dedication to learning and improving himself while at work was clear.\r\nTo anyone considering becoming an apprentice, I would urge you to grasp this opportunity. It takes a great deal of confidence and self-awareness to decide that you would rather pursue professional experience instead of further study at university, and most employers will value this mature and foresightful approach.\r\nApprenticeships are a sure-fire route to both upgrading the nation’s skill base and helping younger people start their working lives, and I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending them as a first-class way of starting a career.\r\n\r\nSajid Javid is Member of Parliament for Bromsgrove and Financial Secretary to the Treasury. Born in Rochdale, England, his father was a bus driver, and he attended state schools before winning a place at Exeter University to study Economics and Politics. He joined the Conservative Party in 1988 and has been an active volunteer ever since.\r\nDominic Woodbridge was employed as Sajid’s apprentice in the House of Commons. When Sajid was made Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to George Osborne, this provided Dominic with increased responsibility, which has gone on to develop following Sajid’s promotion to Economic Secretary to the Treasury.','','','','',NULL,'','2013-12-19 14:27:07','2013-12-19 14:27:07');

It was great to get to work with different people and share knowledge, and it enabled me to bring together all of the aspects that go into being an elite athlete.\r\nThe programme worked so well alongside my training as it enabled me to focus on the aspects that enhance my all-round performance. Along with the flexibility and massive help I received from the programme staff, the AASE programme was ideal for me as an elite athlete, and I was so happy to gain the qualification as well as my sporting achievements.\r\nIn the future, I plan to continue swimming and representing Great Britain at an international level. I hope to compete at Rio 2016.

INSERT INTO `how_to_applies` (`id`,`content`,`created_at`,`updated_at`,`help_title`) VALUES (11,'<p>There are many good things to say about Apprenticeships. Here\'s ten for starters.<b><br></b></p><p><b>1. Something for everyone</b> – Worried you won’t find something that interests you? That\r\nshouldn’t be a problem: there are over 250 Apprenticeship schemes available,\r\ncovering pretty much every sort of career.<br><br><b>2. The real world</b> – Lots of people can’t wait to get out of full-time education\r\n– they want to be\r\nout in the world, doing a proper job and earning proper money. An\r\nApprenticeship allows you to do this while still building up skills for the\r\nfuture.<br><b><br>3. Earn while you learn</b> – You’re paid a wage when you do an Apprenticeship, and having\r\nan income will make a major difference to your life.\r\nIt’s money you deserve: you may still be learning, but you’re doing a proper\r\njob and making a real contribution to your employer’s business.<br><b><br>4. Location, location, location</b> – Except for obvious exceptions like seafishing, most\r\nApprenticeships are offered all over the country. You should be able to find something that suits you in your local area – but\r\nif you want to move somewhere new, an Apprenticeship could be the\r\nideal springboard.<br><b><br>5. Building up Britain</b> – Apprenticeships and other forms of vocational training are vital to the British economy: they build up the skills of our\r\nworkforce and keep us competitive at an international level. New standards\r\nquarantee the quality of Apprenticeships and they are\r\nreceiving lots of support from the Government – there’s never been a better\r\ntime to do one.<br><b><br>6. Meet new friends</b> – You’ll mix with a \r\nwhole new group of people when you take an\r\nApprenticeship. Many companies are very sociable places, and you’ll \r\nprobably spend quite a bit of time with your new colleagues outside \r\nwork. That\r\ndoesn’t mean you’ll lose your old friends, but having new ones\r\ncan only be a bonus.<br><b><br>7. Practical lessons</b> – Taking an Apprenticeship means spending some time in the\r\nclassroom, but the lessons you learn will be directly related to the job you’re\r\ndoing and they’ll help you in your working life. It’s nothing like school:\r\nthese are lessons for professional adults, which is exactly what you’ll be.\r\nYou’ll receive at least 280 hours of guided learning per year.<br><b><br>8. A flying start</b> – You’ll progress much more quickly in your career\r\nif you pick up some formal skills and qualifications along the way. You’ll work\r\nalongside experienced staff to gain job-specific skills. Taking an\r\nApprenticeship means you’ll receive a high-quality, nationally recognised\r\nqualification – such as an NVQ. Getting paid to give yourself a headstart in\r\nthe job market sounds like a pretty good idea.<br><b><br>9. Growing up fast</b> – Many people find that the experience of getting a job\r\nquickly makes them more capable and confident. Having professional\r\nresponsibilities can be challenging, but it’s a positive kind of challenge that\r\nshould make a great difference to your life.<br><b><br>10. Transferable skills</b> – Taking an Apprenticeship doesn’t restrict you to one\r\nspecific job role. You’ll pick up a number of skills\r\nthat’ll make you more attractive to other employers, from basic skills like\r\nteamwork and health and safety awareness, to more specialised capabilities that\r\nwill help you progress through your industry.\r\n</p>','2012-12-06 15:10:01','2012-12-06 15:10:01','Benefits of an Apprenticeship');

You can change jobs \r\nand take your skills and qualifications with you.</p><p><b>Training</b>\r\n – With an Apprenticeship under your belt, employers will know that \r\nyou’ve got the skills and training needed to do the job and they’ll be \r\nmore likely to hire you.\r\n</p><p><b>Other perks</b> – You’ll get paid holidays plus pension contributions, subsidised canteen and leisure facilities, etc. – the same benefits as other employees.</p>\r\n','<p>There are three levels of Apprenticeship:</p><p><b>Intermediate Level</b> – gain a work-based qualification such as a Level 2 NVQ (equivalent to five GCSEs at grades A–C).</p><p><b>Advanced Level</b> – gain a work-based qualification such as a Level 3 NVQ (equivalent to two A-levels).<b><br></b></p><p><b>Higher Apprenticeship</b>\r\n – work towards a work-based qualification such as a Level 4 NVQ and, in\r\n some cases, a knowledge-based qualification such as a Foundation \r\nDegree.</p>\r\n','<b>1. Something for everyone</b> – Worried you won’t find something that interests you? That\r\nshouldn’t be a problem: there are over 250 Apprenticeship schemes available,\r\ncovering pretty much every sort of career.<br><br><b>2. The real world</b> – Lots of people can’t wait to get out of full-time education\r\n– they want to be\r\nout in the world, doing a proper job and earning proper money. An\r\nApprenticeship allows you to do this while still building up skills for the\r\nfuture.<br><b><br>3. Earn while you learn</b> – You’re paid a wage when you do an Apprenticeship, and having\r\nan income will make a major difference to your life.\r\nIt’s money you deserve: you may still be learning, but you’re doing a proper\r\njob and making a real contribution to your employer’s business.<br><b><br>4. Location, location, location</b> – Except for obvious exceptions like seafishing, most\r\nApprenticeships are offered all over the country. You should be able to find something that suits you in your local area – but\r\nif you want to move somewhere new, an Apprenticeship could be the\r\nideal springboard.<br><b><br>5. Building up Britain</b> – Apprenticeships and other forms of vocational training are vital to the British economy: they build up the skills of our\r\nworkforce and keep us competitive at an international level. New standards\r\nquarantee the quality of Apprenticeships and they are\r\nreceiving lots of support from the Government – there’s never been a better\r\ntime to do one.<br><b><br>6.
