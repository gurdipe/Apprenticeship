Likewise, if you're already working, you may be looking to try something new altogether or to improve your skills and knowledge to help you progress up the career ladder. You may also want to improve your prospects of finding a job in your chosen industry.\r\n\r\nWhether you're looking for your first role or are already in employment, Apprenticeships give you the chance to do just that. They enable you to enter or stay in the world of work, earn a decent wage and learn new skills.  An Apprenticeship will offer you amazing opportunities to shine in a job you enjoy.\r\n\r\nApprenticeships mix on-the-job training with classroom learning.  They provide you with the skills you need for your chosen career that will also lead to nationally-recognised qualifications. As an Apprentice you earn while you learn and receive other benefits as well.

Salaries vary, but apprentices earn an average of £170 per week.\r\n\r\nFunding\r\nWhile you’re on an Apprenticeship, your employer pays you a salary and supports you in your training – most of your learning will happen at work, but some might take place with a training provider.\r\n\r\nFinancial help is available and you won’t have to pay any fees. If you’re between 16 and 18, the Government will pay the full cost of your training (if you’re over 19, your employer may be expected to contribute to your training costs). The funding you’re eligible to receive depends entirely on your circumstances, your employer and the type of Apprenticeship. Don’t worry – your employer will work with you to try and support your individual requirements.\r\n\r\nSalary\r\nThe National Minimum Wage is £2.60 per hour for apprentices under 19, or those who are aged 19 or over but are in the first year of their Apprenticeship. Many employers will pay you more as you develop your skills – the average apprentice takes home around £170 per week.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that completing an Apprenticeship will mean you earn more in the long run – research shows that apprentices earn, on average, around £73,000 more over their lifetime than other employees, and this figure rises to £100,000 for those who have completed an Advanced Level Apprenticeship – you’ll also be more employable than those who leave education without these qualifications.\r\n\r\nOther benefits\r\nAs an apprentices you will receive the same benefits as other employees in the company – this may include pension contributions and subsidised canteen and leisure facilities. You may also be entitled to additional money for essential books, clothing or equipment, or to help you with a disability. You’ll get paid holidays too.\r\n\r\nIn special circumstances there are Learner Support Funds available, depending on your situation, the type of Apprenticeship you are doing, and your age. These vary depending on your employer and learning provider and need to be discussed with them individually.\r\n\r\n\r\nQualifications\r\n\r\nYou’ll gain nationally recognised qualifications that will be valid for any employer. That means you can change jobs and take your skills and qualifications with you.\r\n\r\nAll Apprenticeships include the following elements:\r\n\r\n• A competencies qualification which you’ll need to achieve to qualify for your Apprenticeship certificate. This qualification shows that you are competent in performing the skill,\r\n\r\ntrade or occupation your Apprenticeship requires.\r\n• A technical knowledge qualification to show you have the necessary technical skills, knowledge and understanding of theoretical concepts as well as knowledge and understanding of the relevant industry and its market.\r\n• Either Key Skills (e.g. team-working, problem-solving, communication and using new technology) or Functional Skills to help you achieve a good standard of literacy and numeracy.\r\n\r\nThere are three levels of Apprenticeship:\r\n• Intermediate Level Apprenticeship\r\n• Advanced Level Apprenticeship\r\n• Higher Level Apprenticeship\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nWith an Apprenticeship under your belt, employers will know that you’ve got the skills and training needed to do the job and they’ll be more likely to hire you.

No matter where you start your career, if you have the determination and are ready to work hard, there'll be plenty of scope to move up the career ladder.

Those with a flair for organisation could help make sure projects run on time and within budget; liaise with suppliers; or assist a civil engineer with design plans - there are many places to put your creative skills to the test.\r\n\r\nWith a construction Apprenticeship, you could be working on various sites in your region and beyond - there are also plenty of opportunities to work abroad, as many of the largest construction companies operate around the world.

This sector, also known as the voluntary sector, consists of a range of charities and organisations that exist to help the local, national and, in some cases, the international community. Examples of such organisations include, Macmillan Cancer Support, Children in Need, Comic Relief, Unicef and Oxfam. As well as the large charities, over 50% of the sector consists of small organisations that help the local community. For example there may be a small organisation in your area that is helping to regenerate the community, or providing services for disadvantaged people.\r\n\r\nThere is a huge variety of paid employment available and there is currently a demand for Apprenticeships within this sector. New apprenticeships have been specifically developed and tailored for three professional roles within the voluntary sector: Fundraising, Campaigning and Volunteer Management.\r\n\r\nBy undertaking an Apprenticeship within one of these areas you will develop the necessary skills to provide you with a great start in a career within this sector. The skills you learn will also give you the opportunity to work in the voluntary sector permanently, meaning you can play a big part in achieving real changes in society.\r\n\r\nIf you are already employed by a voluntary sector organisation, completing an Apprenticeship will further enhance your CV by recognising your learning and development through nationally accredited qualifications. It also offers you the opportunity to professionalise your job roles through recognised learning.\r\n\r\nThe ability to complete Functional Skills in English, Maths and ICT along with an interest in the work of work of charities, social enterprises or voluntary and community organisations is the only entry requirement for these apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nA career in this sector can be very challenging but at the same time extremely rewarding.", :full_content => "", :discipline_id => 4, :created_at => "2012-07-20 01:56:50", :updated_at => "2012-07-20 01:56:50", :article_type => nil },
  { :type_id => 2, :title => "Creative, Media & Arts Apprenticeships", :small_content => "The arts world covers everything from film to fashion, music to computer gaming. While it's the artists and actors, musicians and models who take centre stage, they wouldn't be there without armies of assistants and teams of technicians - just take a look at the number of crew members listed in the credits next time you watch a film.\r\n\r\nThe creative industries are very popular, with lots of competition for job roles. It's not easy to walk into your dream job in TV or the fashion industry, so an Apprenticeship can be a great way to get a foot in the door.\r\n\r\nCreativity takes on many forms, and likewise, the creative industry encompasses a broad array of jobs requiring different practices, talents and skills. The Apprenticeships in this section sample a good portion of that range. If you're technically creative, then you could be a games tester searching for glitches in new computer games or help rig the lighting for a playhouse. Like working with your hands? Then you could learn how to build sets and stages for film productions, or how to work the machines that manufacture clothing.\r\n\r\nThere's also a strong administrative side to this industry, so you could find yourself contributing to the office of a busy record label, helping to promote a live event, or organising member information for a theatre. You could even take on a more socially-engaged role by working for a community arts programme.\r\n\r\nYou'll find most opportunities in London and larger cities, but there are openings for creative types in most places. Imagination and a flair for English, art, music or a similar creative subject can help you succeed in the creative industries. But this is also a sector where passion and hard work will get you far.\r\n\r\nDon't expect the red carpet treatment right away - long, antisocial hours are not unusual, and the pay is often not great for junior staff. But the work is fun and fulfilling, and you'll be working with interesting and creative people.\r\n\r\n", :full_content => "", :discipline_id => 5, :created_at => "2012-07-20 01:57:41", :updated_at => "2012-07-20 01:57:41", :article_type => nil },
  { :type_id => 2, :title => "Customer Service Apprenticeships", :small_content => "View Customer Service & Retail Apprenticeships\r\n\r\nA well-known rule of business is that it's easier to sell to your existing customers than to find new ones. A satisfied customer is not only a good advert for your business, but they're likely to buy from you again. An unhappy customer, on the other hand, is not just a customer you've lost - they can also do untold damage to your reputation.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that a whole field has grown up devoted to keeping customers happy. In a small shop, customer service can be as simple - and important - as the person behind the counter giving a friendly greeting and helping shoppers find what they're looking for. Larger businesses and other organisations might employ a dedicated customer service team, whose job it is to answer questions, give advice and offer refunds on faulty products or services. They're also the ones who have to sort out problems and deal with complaints.\r\n\r\nCustomer service often involves dealing with the public face-to-face, but as many companies now have clients all round the world, telephone call centres and computer helpdesks are becoming increasingly important.\r\n\r\nAs well as serving their existing customers, businesses need to find new ones - and to persuade them to buy things. This is where sales comes in - salespeople persuade customers to buy products or services, and the business they bring in keeps the customer services team busy.\r\n\r\nCustomer service is at the heart of most business activity, so the skills gained from the Apprenticeships in this section will prove valuable across a range of industries and roles.", :full_content => "", :discipline_id => 6, :created_at => "2012-07-20 01:58:46", :updated_at => "2012-07-20 01:58:46", :article_type => nil },
  { :type_id => 2, :title => "Energy & Power Apprenticeships", :small_content => "View Energy Apprenticeships\r\n\r\nThe essential energy and utilities sector covers the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity; the transportation, distribution and supply of gas; the collection, purification and distribution of water; waste management and the collection and treatment of sewerage; and nuclear fuel processing. The Apprenticeships in this section provide entry routes into all of these areas.\r\n\r\nKeeping gas, electricity and water supply in check isn't easy. By nature, gas hates being in an enclosed space and is always looking for a place to escape. A gas leak could potentially cause an explosion, so anyone working with this substance needs to be highly skilled - any mistake could have serious consequences.\r\n\r\nThis section also features two Apprenticeships in the growing nuclear industry, which produces roughly 20% of the electricity in the UK. The provision of nuclear power and the safe decommissioning (or closing down) of the UK's older nuclear power plants both rate highly on the government agenda. This sort of work involves skills that are transferable to other sectors within this industry, as well as engineering.\r\n\r\nThe many roles in this sector require people with all sorts of skills. Practical roles like pipe fitting, line repair and cable jointing are in high demand, as are plant operatives. There's also a large administrative and commercial side to the industry.\r\n\r\nEvery household and company in the country has an electricity bill to pay - that's a lot of customers to look after, and a lot of administrative work. All the major supply companies have large contact centres to deal with areas like customer service and sales.\r\n\r\nApprenticeships are a popular method of entry into this sector, and many of today's managers and supervisors were once apprentices. Also, much of the skilled workforce is now approaching retirement age, which means excellent career prospects when you qualify.", :full_content => "", :discipline_id => 7, :created_at => "2012-07-20 01:59:38", :updated_at => "2012-07-20 01:59:38", :article_type => nil },
  { :type_id => 2, :title => "Engineering & Electrical Apprenticeships ", :small_content => "View engineering and electrical apprenticeships\r\n\r\nWe live in a world constantly in motion: electricity fizzing around at the speed of light along power lines, through cables into billions of light bulbs and motors, industrial machines and household appliances. Voices babbling down telephone lines and over the radio waves. Gas pumping through pipes into ovens and heaters. Water gushing from taps and cisterns, down drains and into sewers. Computers spinning webs of data while moving pictures bounce off satellites onto TV screens.\r\n\r\nIt's a wonder it doesn't descend into absolute chaos. That it doesn't is thanks to a legion of skilled people making sure their part of the system functions as it should - the plumber mending a broken pipe to the team of electricians wiring up an office block to an engineer servicing a broken escalator.\r\n\r\nThe engineering and electrical sector is all about making things work. It's a huge field, so you'll specialise in a particular area. For example, few Apprenticeships offer as many diverse pathways as the engineering Apprenticeship - you could be demolishing buildings, servicing escalators, checking RAF aircraft or activating phone lines for BT - and that's just the start of a long list of opportunities.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: you'll need to be good with machines, whether your specialism is fixing faulty DVD players in a local electrical store, or maintaining the machinery in a factory. You'll often need to be good with people, too - you might be going into somebody's home to fix their fridge or to stem the flood in their bathroom.\r\n\r\nManual and technical skills are important in this sector, and maths, IT and science are often relevant. You need to be good at following instructions and working as part of a team, but engineers in particular often need to use their own initiative to solve problems.\r\n\r\nProspects are good in this sector. And while there are many large firms on the lookout for skilled employees, a lot of electricians and plumbers are self-employed and run their own companies. If you think you can combine your manual and mechanical skills with a head for business, there's a healthy living to be made.", :full_content => "", :discipline_id => 8, :created_at => "2012-07-20 02:00:33", :updated_at => "2012-07-20 02:00:53", :article_type => nil },
  { :type_id => 2, :title => "Finance & Accounting Apprenticeships ", :small_content => "View finance apprenticeships\r\n\r\nThey say that money makes the world go round, and in many ways they're right. Almost every business is set up in order to make money, and making money is not something that happens automatically - it requires careful planning and constant attention.\r\n\r\nCompanies big and small need teams of people to look after their finances: monitoring who they need to pay, who owes them money and so on. They need people to help them sort out their tax bills and make sure all their employees get paid on time, while making them as profitable as possible. Those finance experts are, generally speaking, people with good organisational skills and a good head for numbers.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, it's not just businesses that need help with their money. From the student taking out a loan to cover tuition fees, to the entrepreneur putting on a festival, to the retired person claiming their pension, everyone needs financial help and advice at some stage. And it's employees in banks, accountants and insurance companies who offer that help. Again, people working in these roles are organised, and good with numbers. But it's equally important to be good with people and enjoy the challenge of helping others achieve their financial goals.\r\n\r\nBy choosing to do an Apprenticeship in this area, you'll have made a shrewd financial decision. You'll be working towards a qualification that should see you earn a higher salary in the future. And instead of running into debt - as you'd be likely to do if you stayed in full time education - you'll be earning while you learn.\r\n\r\nNot only will you be qualified to help other people manage their money, you'll also find it easier to manage your own. And as a great many jobs in the finance sector come with a higher-than-average salary, you could find yourself, quite literally, in the money.", :full_content => "", :discipline_id => 9, :created_at => "2012-07-20 02:01:48", :updated_at => "2012-07-20 02:01:48", :article_type => nil },
  { :type_id => 2, :title => "Agricultural & Land-based Industries Apprenticeships", :small_content => "View Agricultural and Land-based Industries\r\n\r\nThe land-based and environmental industries play a key role in both the national and global economies. In the UK alone, the sector is worth more than £8.9 billion per year, and employs over a million employees and 500,000 volunteers. It's a profitable sector, but that's only part of it - this industry improves quality of life here in the UK by supplying us with food, producing crops, enriching the rural and urban environment, and protecting our natural heritage.\r\n\r\nLand-based and environmental industries can be broken down into three major categories: land management and production, animal health and welfare, and environmental industries. There are a wide variety of jobs in the sector, and most of them are practical, requiring physical effort and work outdoors.\r\n\r\nPeople you will find in the field include general farm workers, gardeners, fencing contractors, tree surgeons and gamekeepers. There are also creative occupations available, such as floristry; as well as caring jobs that include working for animal welfare charities, as a veterinary nurse, or at a kennels or cattery. In addition, there are more technical roles on offer, such as land-based engineering, and many management opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe Apprenticeships in this section cover 17 different disciplines, from land-based engineering to veterinary nursing. Each of these industries offers the chance to develop skills in practical, technical and specialised areas with opportunities for career progression.
