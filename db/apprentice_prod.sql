You may also want to improve your prospects of finding a job in your chosen industry.\r\n\r\nWhether you\'re looking for your first role or are already in employment, Apprenticeships give you the chance to do just that. They enable you to enter or stay in the world of work, earn a decent wage and learn new skills.  An Apprenticeship will offer you amazing opportunities to shine in a job you enjoy.\r\n\r\nApprenticeships mix on-the-job training with classroom learning.

Salaries vary, but apprentices earn an average of £170 per week.\r\n\r\nFunding\r\nWhile you’re on an Apprenticeship, your employer pays you a salary and supports you in your training – most of your learning will happen at work, but some might take place with a training provider.\r\n\r\nFinancial help is available and you won’t have to pay any fees. If you’re between 16 and 18, the Government will pay the full cost of your training (if you’re over 19, your employer may be expected to contribute to your training costs). The funding you’re eligible to receive depends entirely on your circumstances, your employer and the type of Apprenticeship. Don’t worry – your employer will work with you to try and support your individual requirements.\r\n\r\nSalary\r\nThe National Minimum Wage is £2.60 per hour for apprentices under 19, or those who are aged 19 or over but are in the first year of their Apprenticeship. Many employers will pay you more as you develop your skills – the average apprentice takes home around £170 per week.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that completing an Apprenticeship will mean you earn more in the long run – research shows that apprentices earn, on average, around £73,000 more over their lifetime than other employees, and this figure rises to £100,000 for those who have completed an Advanced Level Apprenticeship – you’ll also be more employable than those who leave education without these qualifications.\r\n\r\nOther benefits\r\nAs an apprentices you will receive the same benefits as other employees in the company – this may include pension contributions and subsidised canteen and leisure facilities. You may also be entitled to additional money for essential books, clothing or equipment, or to help you with a disability. You’ll get paid holidays too.\r\n\r\nIn special circumstances there are Learner Support Funds available, depending on your situation, the type of Apprenticeship you are doing, and your age. These vary depending on your employer and learning provider and need to be discussed with them individually.\r\n\r\n\r\nQualifications\r\n\r\nYou’ll gain nationally recognised qualifications that will be valid for any employer. That means you can change jobs and take your skills and qualifications with you.\r\n\r\nAll Apprenticeships include the following elements:\r\n\r\n• A competencies qualification which you’ll need to achieve to qualify for your Apprenticeship certificate.

Administrators do a bit of everything: deal with internal and external correspondence; type up letters, agendas and reports; send emails and faxes; answer phone calls... It\'s no wonder that many upper level staff members rely on the assistance of administrators to do their jobs.\r\n\r\nBusiness Management staff - from team leaders and supervisors up to company directors - make decisions about how to do things effectively and provide leadership. Equally important are human resources (HR), who look after the people who work for the organisation and also help with recruiting and training staff.\r\n\r\nMarketing and public relations (PR) is a method of telling people about your company or product - whether through advertising or sponsorship, publicity stunts or viral videos on the internet. It\'s about attracting customers and keeping them - the foundation of business activity.\r\n\r\nAll of these roles use computers in some way. The IT sector can be divided into two categories: the companies that provide IT solutions - such as web developers - and those that use IT in some form with their business (which is pretty much everyone else).\r\n\r\nMost jobs in this industry are office-based with a typical 9 to 5, Monday to Friday working week.

There are 38 different Apprenticeships covering a range of occupations, from groundworks and plant maintenance to civil engineering and joinery. No matter where you start your career, if you have the determination and are ready to work hard, there\'ll be plenty of scope to move up the career ladder. It\'s also worth noting that in the construction industry, more than 35% of people are their own boss and run their own company.\r\n\r\nThere\'s lots to choose from: if you\'re the sort who enjoys physical work, you could help lay the foundations of a 20-storey building; build scaffolding around a famous landmark due for restoration; plaster the interior of an office building; or maintain heavy plant. Those with a flair for organisation could help make sure projects run on time and within budget; liaise with suppliers; or assist a civil engineer with design plans - there are many places to put your creative skills to the test.\r\n\r\nWith a construction Apprenticeship, you could be working on various sites in your region and beyond - there are also plenty of opportunities to work abroad, as many of the largest construction companies operate around the world.

Examples of such organisations include, Macmillan Cancer Support, Children in Need, Comic Relief, Unicef and Oxfam. As well as the large charities, over 50% of the sector consists of small organisations that help the local community. For example there may be a small organisation in your area that is helping to regenerate the community, or providing services for disadvantaged people.\r\n\r\nThere is a huge variety of paid employment available and there is currently a demand for Apprenticeships within this sector. New apprenticeships have been specifically developed and tailored for three professional roles within the voluntary sector: Fundraising, Campaigning and Volunteer Management.\r\n\r\nBy undertaking an Apprenticeship within one of these areas you will develop the necessary skills to provide you with a great start in a career within this sector. The skills you learn will also give you the opportunity to work in the voluntary sector permanently, meaning you can play a big part in achieving real changes in society.\r\n\r\nIf you are already employed by a voluntary sector organisation, completing an Apprenticeship will further enhance your CV by recognising your learning and development through nationally accredited qualifications.

If you\'re technically creative, then you could be a games tester searching for glitches in new computer games or help rig the lighting for a playhouse. Like working with your hands? Then you could learn how to build sets and stages for film productions, or how to work the machines that manufacture clothing.\r\n\r\nThere\'s also a strong administrative side to this industry, so you could find yourself contributing to the office of a busy record label, helping to promote a live event, or organising member information for a theatre.

A satisfied customer is not only a good advert for your business, but they\'re likely to buy from you again. An unhappy customer, on the other hand, is not just a customer you\'ve lost - they can also do untold damage to your reputation.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that a whole field has grown up devoted to keeping customers happy. In a small shop, customer service can be as simple - and important - as the person behind the counter giving a friendly greeting and helping shoppers find what they\'re looking for. Larger businesses and other organisations might employ a dedicated customer service team, whose job it is to answer questions, give advice and offer refunds on faulty products or services. They\'re also the ones who have to sort out problems and deal with complaints.\r\n\r\nCustomer service often involves dealing with the public face-to-face, but as many companies now have clients all round the world, telephone call centres and computer helpdesks are becoming increasingly important.\r\n\r\nAs well as serving their existing customers, businesses need to find new ones - and to persuade them to buy things. This is where sales comes in - salespeople persuade customers to buy products or services, and the business they bring in keeps the customer services team busy.\r\n\r\nCustomer service is at the heart of most business activity, so the skills gained from the Apprenticeships in this section will prove valuable across a range of industries and roles.','',NULL,6,'2012-07-20 01:58:46','2012-07-20 01:58:46'),(21,2,'Energy & Power Apprenticeships','View Energy Apprenticeships\r\n\r\nThe essential energy and utilities sector covers the generation, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity; the transportation, distribution and supply of gas; the collection, purification and distribution of water; waste management and the collection and treatment of sewerage; and nuclear fuel processing. The Apprenticeships in this section provide entry routes into all of these areas.\r\n\r\nKeeping gas, electricity and water supply in check isn\'t easy. By nature, gas hates being in an enclosed space and is always looking for a place to escape. A gas leak could potentially cause an explosion, so anyone working with this substance needs to be highly skilled - any mistake could have serious consequences.\r\n\r\nThis section also features two Apprenticeships in the growing nuclear industry, which produces roughly 20% of the electricity in the UK. The provision of nuclear power and the safe decommissioning (or closing down) of the UK\'s older nuclear power plants both rate highly on the government agenda. This sort of work involves skills that are transferable to other sectors within this industry, as well as engineering.\r\n\r\nThe many roles in this sector require people with all sorts of skills. Practical roles like pipe fitting, line repair and cable jointing are in high demand, as are plant operatives. There\'s also a large administrative and commercial side to the industry.\r\n\r\nEvery household and company in the country has an electricity bill to pay - that\'s a lot of customers to look after, and a lot of administrative work. All the major supply companies have large contact centres to deal with areas like customer service and sales.\r\n\r\nApprenticeships are a popular method of entry into this sector, and many of today\'s managers and supervisors were once apprentices.

Computers spinning webs of data while moving pictures bounce off satellites onto TV screens.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a wonder it doesn\'t descend into absolute chaos. That it doesn\'t is thanks to a legion of skilled people making sure their part of the system functions as it should - the plumber mending a broken pipe to the team of electricians wiring up an office block to an engineer servicing a broken escalator.\r\n\r\nThe engineering and electrical sector is all about making things work. It\'s a huge field, so you\'ll specialise in a particular area. For example, few Apprenticeships offer as many diverse pathways as the engineering Apprenticeship - you could be demolishing buildings, servicing escalators, checking RAF aircraft or activating phone lines for BT - and that\'s just the start of a long list of opportunities.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: you\'ll need to be good with machines, whether your specialism is fixing faulty DVD players in a local electrical store, or maintaining the machinery in a factory. You\'ll often need to be good with people, too - you might be going into somebody\'s home to fix their fridge or to stem the flood in their bathroom.\r\n\r\nManual and technical skills are important in this sector, and maths, IT and science are often relevant. You need to be good at following instructions and working as part of a team, but engineers in particular often need to use their own initiative to solve problems.\r\n\r\nProspects are good in this sector. And while there are many large firms on the lookout for skilled employees, a lot of electricians and plumbers are self-employed and run their own companies.

They need people to help them sort out their tax bills and make sure all their employees get paid on time, while making them as profitable as possible. Those finance experts are, generally speaking, people with good organisational skills and a good head for numbers.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, it\'s not just businesses that need help with their money. From the student taking out a loan to cover tuition fees, to the entrepreneur putting on a festival, to the retired person claiming their pension, everyone needs financial help and advice at some stage. And it\'s employees in banks, accountants and insurance companies who offer that help. Again, people working in these roles are organised, and good with numbers. But it\'s equally important to be good with people and enjoy the challenge of helping others achieve their financial goals.\r\n\r\nBy choosing to do an Apprenticeship in this area, you\'ll have made a shrewd financial decision. You\'ll be working towards a qualification that should see you earn a higher salary in the future. And instead of running into debt - as you\'d be likely to do if you stayed in full time education - you\'ll be earning while you learn.\r\n\r\nNot only will you be qualified to help other people manage their money, you\'ll also find it easier to manage your own.

INSERT INTO `what_is_an_apprenticeships` VALUES (1,'<p>Apprenticeships offer a mixture of on and off the job training that will give you the skills you need in your chosen career. There are over 250 Apprenticeship frameworks available, suitable for hundreds of different job roles in over 80 different sectors. From social media to seafishing, or from horticulture to hairdressing, find one that suits you.\r\n</p>','<p>An Apprenticeship is just like  a real job. You’ll work with experienced members of staff to learn the exact skills needed for your chosen career, whether that’s hairdressing, cooking or engineering. As well as learning on the job, you’ll go to a college or training provider, usually on a day-release basis, to study towards a nationally recognised qualification, such as an NVQ. It\'s a perfect mix of theory and practical learning.<br></p>\r\n','There are lots of great reasons to do an Apprenticeship, but here are the big ones:<br><b>Money</b> – You’ll be working for an employer and earning a salary while you learn. Salaries vary, but apprentices earn £170 per week on average.<br><b>Qualifications</b> – You’ll gain nationally recognised \r\nqualifications that will be valid for any employer. You can change jobs \r\nand take your skills and qualifications with you.<br><b>Training</b>\r\n – With an Apprenticeship under your belt, employers will know that \r\nyou’ve got the skills and training needed to do the job and they’ll be \r\nmore likely to hire you.\r\n<br><b>Other perks</b> – You’ll get paid holidays plus pension contributions, subsidised canteen and leisure facilities, etc. – the same benefits as other employees.<br>','<p>There are three levels of Apprenticeship:</p><p><b>Intermediate Level</b> – work towards a work-based qualification such as a Level 2 NVQ (equivalent to five GCSEs at grades A–C).</p><p><b>Advanced Level</b> – gain a work-based qualification such as a Level 3 NVQ (equivalent to two A-levels).<b><br></b></p><p><b>Higher Apprenticeship</b>\r\n – work towards a work-based qualification such as a Level 4 NVQ and, in\r\n some cases, a knowledge-based qualification such as a Foundation \r\nDegree.</p>\r\n','<b>1. Something for everyone</b> – Worried you won’t find something that interests you? That\r\nshouldn’t be a problem: there are over 250 Apprenticeship schemes available,\r\ncovering pretty much every sort of career.<br><br><b>2. The real world</b> – Lots of people can’t wait to get out of full-time education\r\n– not because they don’t like learning, but because they want to be\r\nout in the world, doing a proper job and earning proper money. An\r\nApprenticeship allows you to do this while still building up skills for the\r\nfuture.<br><b><br>3. Earn while you learn</b> – You’re paid a wage when you do an Apprenticeship, and having\r\nan income will make a major difference to your life.\r\nIt’s money you deserve: you may still be learning, but you’re doing a proper\r\njob and making a real contribution to your employer’s business.<br><b><br>4. Location, location, location</b> – Except for obvious exceptions like seafishing, most\r\nApprenticeships are offered all over the country. You should be able to find something that suits you in your local area – but\r\nif you want to move somewhere new, an Apprenticeship could be the\r\nideal springboard.<br><b><br>5. Building up Britain</b> – Apprenticeships and other forms of vocational training are vital to the British economy: they build up the skills of our\r\nworkforce and keep us competitive at an international level. New standards\r\nquarantee the quality of Apprenticeships and they are\r\nreceiving lots of support from the Government – there’s never been a better\r\ntime to do one.<br><b><br>6. Meet new friends</b> – You’ll mix with a whole new group of people when you take an\r\nApprenticeship. Many companies are very sociable places, and you’ll probably\r\nfind you spend quite a bit of time with your new colleagues outside work. That\r\ndoesn’t mean you’ll lose your old friends, of course, but having new friends\r\ncan only be a bonus.<br><b><br>7. Practical lessons</b> – Taking an Apprenticeship means spending some time in the\r\nclassroom, but the lessons you learn will be directly related to the job you’re\r\ndoing and they’ll help you in your working life. It’s nothing like school:\r\nthese are lessons for professional adults, which is exactly what you’ll be.\r\nYou’ll receive at least 280 hours of guided learning per year.<br><b><br>8. A flying start</b> – You’ll progress much more quickly in your career\r\nif you pick up some formal skills and qualifications along the way. You’ll work\r\nalongside experienced staff to gain job-specific skills. Taking an\r\nApprenticeship means you’ll receive a high-quality, nationally recognised\r\nqualification – such as an NVQ. Getting paid to give yourself a headstart in\r\nthe job market sounds like a pretty good idea.<br><b><br>9. Growing up fast</b> – Many people find that the experience of getting a job\r\nquickly makes them more capable and confident. Having professional\r\nresponsibilities can be challenging, but it’s a positive kind of challenge that\r\nshould make a great difference to your life.<br><b><br>10. Transferable skills</b> – Taking an Apprenticeship doesn’t restrict you to one\r\nspecific job role. During your training you’ll pick up a number of skills\r\nthat’ll make you more attractive to other employers, from basic skills like\r\nteamwork and health and safety awareness, to more specialised capabilities that\r\nwill help you progress through your industry.\r\n','2012-09-27 19:48:16','2012-11-12 11:12:20');
